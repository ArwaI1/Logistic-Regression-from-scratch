# Predicting Heart Disease Using Logistic Regression

This project utilizes logistic regression to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. It demonstrates the entire process of working with a heart disease dataset, including data cleaning, preprocessing, model training using logistic regression, and evaluation of the model's performance.


## Installation

Before running this project, you'll need Python installed on your system. The project dependencies can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Dataset

This project uses a publicly available heart disease dataset that includes the following key features:

- Age: The age of the individual.
- Sex: The gender of the individual (male/female).
- cp (Chest Pain type): The type of chest pain experienced.
- trestbps (Resting Blood Pressure): Blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
- chol (Serum Cholesterol): Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
- fbs (Fasting Blood Sugar): Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl.
- restecg (Resting Electrocardiographic Results): Resting electrocardiographic measurement.
- thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved): Maximum heart rate achieved.
- exang (Exercise Induced Angina): Exercise-induced angina (Yes/No).
- oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest): ST depression level.
- slope: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
- ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
- thal: Presence of thalassemia.

The target variable is `target`, indicating the presence of heart disease in the individual.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. Open the `Heart_Disease_Prediction.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially from top to bottom.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The notebook begins with cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and removing duplicates. Continuous features are scaled to ensure they are on a similar scale.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis is conducted to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
- **Model Implementation**: Logistic regression is implemented from scratch, using a sigmoid function for the prediction of binary outcomes.
- **Feature Selection**: Techniques for selecting the most influential features for heart disease prediction.

## Model Training

The logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed dataset. A detailed explanation of the sigmoid function, cost function, and gradient descent algorithm used for optimization is provided.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. A confusion matrix is also presented to visualize the model's performance in classifying the instances.
